# The-Gaming-Room

We had a company called "The Gaming Room" that wanted to build a web-based game that was in relation to their game "Draw it or Lose It" which they had already made available to Android. Now they wanted to make the game available to all other platforms. 


I feel that I did well with the information presented in my document. I believe the information provided effectively shows the client their options while also explaining my recommendation.


I found the design document to be extremely helpful in developing the code as it set the parameters for me to follow making it easy to accomplish the goal within the proper constraints. 


If I could revise one aspect of the project it would be the code itself I feel the least confident in its efficiency. I would do more testing within the code i would also research other code that accomplished similar tasks to see if I was accomplishing the goal as effectively as possible.


You have to consider the user's need to ensure you are making a product that meets their requirements but above that, as a developer you need to create work you can be proud of. Creating a project that both you and the client can be satisfied with will also result in you receiving more clients. In our case, the user needed to not only be able to reach all platforms but also accommodate each platform and consider the end user as well. for example, the amount of storage needed for the game computers and consoles typically can hold more data than phones so the game needs to be capable of accommodating both and should strive to be as small as possible.


My approach when designing the software was to stick as close as possible to the goals without striving away and making unnecessary adjustments. A minimalist mindset is what I consider it. This does not mean that you do the bare minimum. you achieve the goals but ensure you create an efficient and well-designed product. In the future, I would use this same process for me it is the most efficient and effective.
